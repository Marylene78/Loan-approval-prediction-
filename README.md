Loan Approval Prediction The Loan Approval Prediction project is a machine learning model designed to determine the likelihood of loan approval based on applicant and financial information.
Using a dataset that includes features such as Applicant Income, Coapplicant Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, Property Area, Dependents, and Marital Status, the model identifies key patterns and relationships to predict whether a loan application will be approved.

This model uses supervised learning techniques to analyze how factors like income levels, credit history, and loan amount influence approval decisions. 
It also considers the applicantâ€™s family size and marital status to provide a comprehensive analysis. The inclusion of Property Area (urban, semi-urban, or rural) allows the model to account for regional variations in loan approval criteria.

To get started, clone the repository and load your dataset in the appropriate format. Follow the provided instructions to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance. 
The model generates predictions that can be used to streamline loan application processes, reduce manual evaluation time, and improve decision accuracy.
